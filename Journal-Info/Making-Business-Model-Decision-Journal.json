Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 261 entrepreneurial firms, the study highlights the positive effects of scientific methods (hypothesis testing, evidence collection, and disciplined evaluation) on firms with mature business models, transitional challenges (epistemic uncertainty) faced by firms still refining their business models, and the catalytic role of scientific approaches in driving long-term performance gains."
