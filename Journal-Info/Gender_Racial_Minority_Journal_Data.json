      "abstract": "This study delves into the intersection of board diversity, subgroup dynamics, and firm performance, focusing on multinational enterprises (MNEs). By integrating faultline theory and institutional theory, it highlights how observable diversity characteristics such as gender and race can form subgroups, often resulting in faultlines. These faultlines may foster conflict or collaboration, impacting board decision-making and, ultimately, firm performance. The study offers empirical evidence from a longitudinal analysis of 500 MNEs, emphasizing the dual-edged nature of diversity and the critical role of inclusivity practices in optimizing outcomes. The findings offer valuable insights for practitioners aiming to leverage diversity for strategic advantage.",
