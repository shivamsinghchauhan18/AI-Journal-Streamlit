      "abstract": "Although rising geopolitical tension is critically affecting multinational enterprises (MNEs), our understanding of geopolitics and its effects on corporate strategy is surprisingly limited. This study sheds light on this underexplored topic by examining the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy of foreign MNEs amid tension between their home and host countries. The study identifies the critical role of media in shaping public perceptions of geopolitical tension and argues that such tension leads foreign MNEs to enhance ESG performance. Historical conflicts positively moderate this relationship, while ongoing conflicts diminish it.",
